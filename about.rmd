## About my data sources:
I was able to find a .csv file of all NYT crosswords from 2009-2016 on the Internet, with information including a puzzle's day of publication, its author, each clue in the puzzle and the corresponding answer. I also found a website (https://laxcrossword.com/) that has the same information, but for the Los Angeles Times. I plan to scrape that website and format it in the same way as the NYT dataframe, in order to work with both datasets more easily. I plan to get all the data into the repo within the next few days, after some amount of cleanup.
